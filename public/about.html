  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> I am presently employed as an Assistant Language Teacher in Japanese public schools 
    located in Hamamatsu. In pursuit of new career avenues, I have developed a strong 
    inclination toward the field of web development.</p>
    
    <p>While my current residence is in Hamamatsu, I am open to relocation opportunities. 
      My professional ethos revolves around seeking and embracing challenges, motivating me
       to transition into a career that offers consistent opportunities for personal and 
       professional growth. </p>
    
    <p>I have previously resided in Japan for a cumulative period of six months during my academic 
    pursuits, and I have been residing here again since March 2023.</p>
    
    <p>I appreciate your time and consideration in reviewing my portfolio, and I eagerly anticipate 
    the possibility of further discussion. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
