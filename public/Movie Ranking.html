<h1>Sam's Movie Picks!</h1>
<h2>These are my top movies of the 2020's so far!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1 - Last Night in Soho</h3>
<p>Edgar wright stepped away from his usual, more familiar
    comedy genre for this spooky adventure within the Soho 
    district of London. Recommended by Sam.
</p>
<h3>2 - Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>A feel good aventure for all the family. Very little 
    to go wrong in this movie. Tom cruise is fun! Recommended by Sam.
</p>
<h3>3 - Everything, Everywhere, All at once</h3>
<p>A film that is so unpredictable and endearing that everyone should
    watch this just to understand how importantly unimportant
    everyting really is. Recommended by Sam.
